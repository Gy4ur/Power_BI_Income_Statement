# Income Statement Report
The scenario here is that we have monthly finance transactional data CSV files for each month from Jan 2007 to May 2008 
(e.g. extracts from a ERP system) which we need to combine and analyze, bringing in the latest data on a monthly basis
and showing MTD/QTD/YTD performance as well as a comparison to the prior year in Power BI.
